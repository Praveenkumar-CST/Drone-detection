Drone Detection Project
Overview
This project involves the development of a drone detection system using Python. The system is designed to identify and track drones in various environments through a combination of signal processing and machine learning techniques.

Features
Real-time Drone Detection: Monitors and detects the presence of drones in real-time.
Machine Learning Integration: Utilizes machine learning models to improve detection accuracy.
Signal Processing: Processes signals to differentiate between drones and other objects.
Visualization: Provides visual feedback on detected drones and their locations.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt)
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drone-detection.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd drone-detection
Install the required packages:
